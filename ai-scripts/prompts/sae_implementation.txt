Based on the Anthropic paper on Sparse Autoencoders, please provide a minimal but complete Python implementation of a basic sparse autoencoder. Focus on: 1. Core SAE architecture for a simple use case 2. Key sparsity mechanisms described in the paper 3. Basic training loop 4. Example usage with toy data. Please use PyTorch and include all necessary imports. The implementation should be self-contained and runnable.
