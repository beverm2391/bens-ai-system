## Core Functionality
- reflection: need stricter adherence to plain text only in memory
- reflection: must handle command flags immediately as top priority
- reflection: memory updates should never wait until end of response
- reflection: good workflow adherence but could challenge complexity more
- reflection: notifications working well for key updates
- reflection: .cursorrules should emphasize memory rules more prominently
- e2b code execution implementation complete (2023-12-30)
- created execute.py and execute_file.py in src/e2b
- added error handling and debug logging
- all unit tests now passing
- demo ran successfully showing all features
- direct code execution works with stdout/stderr
- file execution works with proper cleanup
- error handling works for undefined variables
- math calculations and file i/o working correctly
- next: get approval and update directory
- CRITICAL LEARNING: memory should never use markdown formatting
- WORKFLOW ERROR: ignored -mem command in previous response
- DOCUMENTATION UPDATE: created setup.md with env and API requirements
- WORKFLOW IMPROVEMENT: external tests now properly marked
- NEW CAPABILITY: semantic web search with Exa API added
- REFLECTION: successfully challenged complex request per rules
- REFLECTION: proposed iterative approach starting with SERP tool
- WORKFLOW: following Claude tool use spec for implementation
- IMPLEMENTATION: created SERP tool as proof of concept
- STRUCTURE: created demos directory with serp subdirectory
- COMPLIANCE: followed Claude tool use spec for schema and implementation
- NEXT: run demo after SERP_API_KEY confirmation
- TEST: SERP tool demo successful with both basic and domain-filtered searches
- VALIDATION: Claude tool spec compliance confirmed
- NEXT: ready for browserbase tool implementation
- REFLECTION: needed to create proper Claude integration demo for tool
- IMPLEMENTATION: created demo_serp_claude.py following demo_claude_tools.py pattern
- WORKFLOW: tool can now be used directly by Claude for web searches
- NEXT: test Claude's interaction with SERP tool
- REFLECTION: leveraged existing E2B implementation from src/e2b
- IMPLEMENTATION: created e2b_tool.py with Claude-compliant schema
- STRUCTURE: created demos/e2b directory with demo script
- NEXT: test Claude's interaction with E2B tool
- REFLECTION: improved E2B tool with better logging and result handling
- ENHANCEMENT: added success flag and empty string defaults
- IMPROVEMENT: created more detailed demo prompt for Claude
- NEXT: test improved E2B implementation
- DEBUG ANALYSIS: E2B implementation solid but needs production optimizations
- IMPROVEMENT NEEDED: reduce logging verbosity and add retry logic
- ENHANCEMENT: streamline sandbox management and error handling
- COST TRACKING: $0.007408 per basic code execution
- NEXT: await direction on optimizations vs browserbase
- REFLECTION: simplified demo to focus on Claude processing code output
- ISSUE: Claude not showing stdout in response
- NEXT: investigate tool result handling in Claude stream
- ACTION: may need to modify tool executor response format
- REFLECTION: modified E2B tool to include formatted output
- ISSUE: Claude still not showing tool results in response
- NEXT: investigate anthropic client tool result handling
- ACTION: may need to modify stream handling in client
- VERIFICATION: code execution confirmed working (2 + 2 = 4)
- LOGGING: added direct result logging to execution_log.txt
- CONFIRMED: E2B sandbox properly executing Python code
- NEXT: investigate why Claude isn't showing results in response
- IMPROVEMENT: reduced E2B logging noise unless DEBUG_LEVEL > 0
- FIX: corrected E2B sandbox import and result handling
- CONFIRMED: code execution still working with quieter logging
- NEXT: investigate Claude result handling in anthropic client
- INVESTIGATION: streaming chunks not properly capturing tool use
- NEXT: examine anthropic client stream format
- ACTION: may need to modify stream handling in client
- IMPROVEMENT: added better chunk type handling
- REFLECTION: simplified to basic non-streaming version first
- SUCCESS: tool use flow working with direct Anthropic client
- INSIGHT: streaming version needs to match this message format
- NEXT: update streaming version to match working flow
- REFLECTION: simplified to stream only final response
- SUCCESS: hybrid approach working with direct tool use and streamed explanation
- INSIGHT: keeping synchronous parts direct makes code cleaner
- NEXT: ready for browserbase implementation
- INITIALIZATION: agent loaded and reviewed all documentation
- STATUS: ready for browserbase implementation per memory
- WORKFLOW: following hybrid approach with direct tool use and streamed explanation
- REFLECTION: simplified E2B demo to match basic pattern
- IMPROVEMENT: removed two-step interaction for cleaner flow
- NEXT: test simplified demo with debug logging
- REFLECTION: simplified demo to match basic version for clearer logging
- IMPROVEMENT: each step now clearly visible to user
- INSIGHT: simpler synchronous flow better than complex streaming
- NEXT: ready for browserbase implementation
- IMPROVEMENT: cleaned up logging to only show user-relevant info
- ENHANCEMENT: debug logs now properly respect DEBUG_LEVEL
- INSIGHT: simpler output makes tool use more approachable
- NEXT: ready for browserbase implementation
