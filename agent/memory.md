- reflection: need stricter adherence to plain text only in memory
- reflection: must handle command flags immediately as top priority
- reflection: memory updates should never wait until end of response
- reflection: good workflow adherence but could challenge complexity more
- reflection: notifications working well for key updates
- reflection: .cursorrules should emphasize memory rules more prominently
- e2b code execution implementation complete (2023-12-30)
- created execute.py and execute_file.py in src/e2b
- added error handling and debug logging
- all unit tests now passing
- demo ran successfully showing all features
- direct code execution works with stdout/stderr
- file execution works with proper cleanup
- error handling works for undefined variables
- math calculations and file i/o working correctly
- next: get approval and update directory
- CRITICAL LEARNING: memory should never use markdown formatting
- WORKFLOW ERROR: ignored -mem command in previous response
- DOCUMENTATION UPDATE: created setup.md with env and API requirements
- WORKFLOW IMPROVEMENT: external tests now properly marked
- NEW CAPABILITY: semantic web search with Exa API added
- REFLECTION: successfully challenged complex request per rules
- REFLECTION: proposed iterative approach starting with SERP tool
- WORKFLOW: following Claude tool use spec for implementation
- IMPLEMENTATION: created SERP tool as proof of concept
- STRUCTURE: created demos directory with serp subdirectory
- COMPLIANCE: followed Claude tool use spec for schema and implementation
- NEXT: run demo after SERP_API_KEY confirmation
- TEST: SERP tool demo successful with both basic and domain-filtered searches
- VALIDATION: Claude tool spec compliance confirmed
- NEXT: ready for browserbase tool implementation
- REFLECTION: needed to create proper Claude integration demo for tool
- IMPLEMENTATION: created demo_serp_claude.py following demo_claude_tools.py pattern
- WORKFLOW: tool can now be used directly by Claude for web searches
- NEXT: test Claude's interaction with SERP tool
