# AI Organization Structure

### 1. Agents
- AI entities with specific roles and tools (code execution, file editing, knowledge base querying)
- Operate in "thought-action loop" for iterative information gathering
- Distinct personalities and biases from reinforcement-tuned models
- Named roles for clarity (e.g., "Rob, Financial Analyst")

### 2. Orchestrator
- Higher-level AI coordinator (C-suite executive level)
- Manages agents and ensures cohesive operation
- Engages in simulated meetings with agents

### 3. Organization Structure
- Mimics human organization hierarchy
- EverTech: Ben's AI organization
  - Ben as CEO
  - Board (including Orchestrator) defines mission, values, and planning

## System Design

### Cognitive Architecture
- Each agent uses unique cognitive loop
- Different models and thinking patterns
- Supports diverse personalities and behaviors

### Interfaces
- Coding environment (IDE)
- Markdown writing/prototyping environment
- Potential web browser integration
- Human control and interaction capabilities

### Integration Features
- Text chat input
- Audio input capability
- Potential Zoom call simulation
- Meeting transcript generation
- Video call interface with AI personas for direct org-like interactions

## Leadership Responsibilities

### Board/CEO Tasks
- Mission and values definition
- Strategic planning oversight
- Agent and orchestrator coordination
- Operational effectiveness management
