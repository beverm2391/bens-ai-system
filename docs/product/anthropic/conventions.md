## Style
- Python: PEP 8
- Clear names over clever ones
- Comments only for complex logic
- Type hints on public interfaces

## Documentation
- README in each directory
- Docstrings: Google style
- Keep docs close to code
- Update docs with code changes

## Testing
- pytest
- Test files named: test_*.py
- Focus on critical paths
- Keep tests simple and readable

## Git
- Atomic commits
- Clear commit messages
- Feature branches when needed
- Main branch always stable
