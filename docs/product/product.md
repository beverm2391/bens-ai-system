### Portal

Concept: exec/founder/stakeholder will periodically review this portal and provide feedback. You will demo content for them, generate reports, and visualize data.

- Read-only display interface
- File-based updates via watched folder
- Single screen, no routing
- Initial test: Weather app with Tailwind components
- Future support for specialized visualizations (music notation, spreadsheets)
- Clear separation from Cursor (Portal = display, Cursor = input/editing)
