# MVP Overview

Core concept: Single AI agent with basic tools to help Ben code and manage documentation.

## Key Features
- Text-only interface with command triggers (`:think`, `:code`, etc)
- Memory context for consistent interactions
- Basic file operations and code execution
- Documentation management

## Core Loop
1. Ben inputs request/command
2. Agent thinks/plans using memory context
3. Agent executes simple actions (read/write/code)
4. Agent maintains documentation

## Success Metrics
- Can handle basic coding tasks
- Maintains consistent memory between interactions
- Properly manages project documentation
- Reduces Ben's cognitive load

## Next Steps
Only expand when current capabilities prove insufficient for core tasks.
